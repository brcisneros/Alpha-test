Hi stranger (I don't know who will evaluate this :P)

I will try to make this short and not whine so much.

First and foremost, I want to thank you all for giving me a chance, for real. I wasn't expecting to have the opportunity to put to test what I learned at the Frontend Course so soon, since it's been just a couple of months that I completed it.

This one here is the very second page that I made, and it was quite an experience to try and make it in just 4 days (my portfolio for the course I made it in 2 months as I learned everything). I'm sure you'll find lots and lots of things that can be improved, code that can be recycled, messy code, or things missing like the countdown or the sections' background (some buttons in the desktop view I actually did not copy exactly as the Figma design, I found it odd that you would change the function of a button and thought that was just a design mistake maybe).

I don't want to make an excuse but PLEASE keep in mind when evaluating that this is really the very second page that I've ever made, and that I've only had like 4 hours a day to dedicate to this. I'm sure that if I had the time I would deliver a more polished work. Regardless of this, I feel really good about the result and again, it was a good experience to me.

Sorry if what I'm saying does not make much sense, I'm writing this with the last two brain cells left alive in my head.

I hope that I made a somewhat decent job. This is what I really want to do for a living, and I know there's a lot that I have yet to learn, but I think that the best way to grow is to actually do stuff, make mistakes and learn from them and from the people you have around. I would love to work with you guys, you seem all really nice people and I really need that too.

Sorry if it extended to much, I hope to hear from you soon!

Have a nice day,

Brian Cisneros.
